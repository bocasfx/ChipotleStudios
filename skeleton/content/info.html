		<p>My name is Rodolfo Palacios. Husband, dad, musician, cook, software developer. I was born in Mexico City in 1975 but Canada has been my home since 2005.</p>

		<p>For many years I struggled deciding wether to be a musician, a software developer or a cook. I have now decided to be all three. Chipotle Studios is my first attempt at that.</p>

        <p>I would definitely not describe myself as a competitive person. Instead, I consider myself to be a <b>collaborative</b> person. I understand that my well-being depends not only on me, but on the collective well-being of <b>everyone else around me</b>.</p>

        <p>If you wish to contact me, you can send me an email to: rodolfo at chipotlestudios dot com.</p>
